<h1><u>Quick hummus recipe</u></h1>


<p><strong>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing.</strong> It has been adapted from a number of
    different recipes that I
    have read over the years.</p>

<p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad,
    grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

<h2><u><mark>Ingredients</mark></u></h2>

<p>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)<br>
    175g of tahini<br>
    6 sundried tomatoes<br>
    Half a red pepper<br>
    A pinch of cayenne pepper<br>
    1 clove of garlic<br>
    A dash of olive oil</p>

<h3><mark>Instructions</mark></h3>

<p><em>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsel<br>
    Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely<br>
    Add all the ingredients into a food processor<br>
    Process all the ingredients into a paste.<br>
    If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time<br>
    If you want a smooth hummus<u>,process it for a longer time</u><br>
</em>
</p>

<p>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and
    chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>

<h4><U><mark>Storage</mark></u></h4>

<p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container.<br>
    You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should
    definitely discard it.</p>

Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
